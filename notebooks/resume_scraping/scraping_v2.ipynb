This has reduced the manual intervention in case of new table added in the database. Implemented data export from one environment to another environment using Fast Export and Fast Load. All that the scripts needs is table name, environment to export, environment to import and user credentials. This gives flexibility of importing data from production to test and to development as when the environments require fresh data. Faster incoming file process automated to loading into teradata staging using BTEQ, Fast Load and then loaded into MLoad by concatenating files on the basis of table name. The technologies used in processes are Teradata, oracle, DB2, UNIX and Mainframes.
