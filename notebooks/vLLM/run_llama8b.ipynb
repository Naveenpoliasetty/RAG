      "Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle cannot be described independently of the others, even when they are separated by large distances. This means that measuring the state of one particle will instantaneously affect the state of the other entangled particles, regardless of the distance between them. This has been experimentally confirmed in various systems, including photons, electrons, and even large-scale objects like superconducting circuits. The phenomenon of quantum entanglement has been observed in many different experiments, including the famous Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox, which was designed to test the completeness of quantum mechanics. Quantum entanglement has many practical applications, including quantum computing, cryptography, and quantum teleportation. Quantum entanglement is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics, and it has been experimentally confirmed in many different systems. It is a key feature of quantum mechanics that has been extensively studied and has many potential applications\n",
